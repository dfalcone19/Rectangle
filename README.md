Very simple java program built to show what we've learned in the first half of the first semester of my program. We've only learned basic java syntax, I/O, and OOP using encapsulation (no if/else, arrays, etc). 

This program uses the rectangle class and creates a rectangle object using encapsulation with user entered values for the length and width, and then returns some basic calculations.
